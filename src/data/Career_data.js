    role: 'Staff System engineer',
    location: 'New York, U.S.',
    description: `As a Distributed Systems/ML engineer, you will work on improving the training throughput 
    for our internal training framework, while enabling researchers to experiment with new ideas.  This requires
    good engineering (for example designing, implementing, and optimizing state-of-the-art AI models), writing 
    bug-free machine learning code (surprisingly difficult!), and acquiring deep knowledge of the performance of 
    supercomputers. In all the projects this role pursues, the ultimate goal is to push the field forward.

    We’re looking for people who love optimizing performance, understanding distributed systems, and who cannot 
    stand having bugs in their code.  Since our training framework is used for large runs with massive numbers of 
    GPUs, performance improvements here will have a large impact.
